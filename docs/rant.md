### my rant

#### intro
this doc should probably not be called rant, however, it's a place to jot down some
information that's guiding this effort into building PER:CMS
y



##### for fun: why peregrine-cms?

The initial working title was hscms (eg headless cms) and (hs)2cms (could be refernced
as headwire's headless cms or headless highspeed cms). While headless and high speed are
certainly at the forefront of why the effort for PER:CMS has been undertaken they 
honestly should not be reflected in the name itself as times change and a product
should be able to evolve over time and not be tied to a certain technology. 

Thus, we settled on peregrine (from the peregrine falcon, the fastest animal in the
world) and since peregrine by itslef is not available as a company name we added
cms to the name as well. This makes the name of the cms officially Peregrine-CMS, PER:CMS
as a shortname for now.
