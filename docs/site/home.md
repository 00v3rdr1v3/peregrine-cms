Peregrine is a very fast modern content management system with an API first approach.

### For Authors

We focus on a seamless authoring experience. Build your pages and see how they will look like
instantly. Base your pages on templates so they can easily adapt over time. Write reusable content
and add do stuff with it... 

### For Developers

Peregrine is an API first content management system - the api first approach takes this headless
cms further. The frontend head of the cms is fully decoupled from the backend making peregrine a
true headless cms. 

By defining a full API for all communication between the frontend and backend peregrine allows us to 
decouple and implement either part in any technology. At this point we provide a  VueJS based head
with a Apache Sling based body. 

### For Load

Contrary to popular believe, Apache Sling used right scales very well. See our numbers.
