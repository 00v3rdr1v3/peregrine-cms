# things we have to document so people can understand it 

A folder under /content/objects can have a allowedObjects array propety. This array contains a list of the names of object types that
are allowed to be created in the folder (and any subfolder [not implemented yet]) Need to decide if we also extend this to the objects
for the ones that allow children to be created
