Traditionally a web server provides an html file and all necessary resources to a browser. The
browser then renders the html, the user takes an action and the browser determines the next html
page to load. 

Through the desire of providing a better user experience to the clients, developers tend to pack
more and more functionality into a website through javascript. 

We strongly believe this shift will continue.
