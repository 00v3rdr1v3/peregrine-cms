A great tool needs great documentation. A(utomatic)DOCS is an effort to create some of the documentation
automatically. Taking screenshots from the product for example should be easy to achieve and that's why
we started this project in the first place. 

### run
```aidl
makeall.bat
```

this will generate  target folder and an `index.html` file in the root. The index.html file contains
a set of screenshots from the product with a set of resolutions (400, 600, ,800,1024,1280)

### next steps

- should make this os independent and handle login
- should run headless as post build
