        If unsure what to do then go to the Composum Package Manager
        (/bin/packages.html) and create a test package. To to the package
        filter list and add filter entries until all of the app provides
        nodes are included but none of the customer generatedd nodes.

        Also any sub pckage of this module needs to exclude /apps/example/install
        folder otherwise they wipe all installed bundles.
